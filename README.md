## Initial MVP idea:
​
Following the initial team meeting, project ideas were shared and the agreed idea was to work on creating a platform to connect female mentors and mentees working in the tech industry. 
​
### Actual idea & content:
​
A web application developed as a part of Code Institute's March Hackathon based on the theme of women in tech. It features services that allow for effective communication for women in navigating the tech industry. The project achieves this by presenting mentorship opportunities through mentor profile cards where users can schedule meetings with the personalities that they feel they associate with the most. Users can find a list of upcoming events that encourage networking among women in tech. And the project also features an inspiration feature where users are presented with profiles of successful women figures.
