## Features

### Mentor Search
In the 'Mentorship Program' section of the page, there is the ability to search for a mentor based on selected criteria. Using radio buttons, users can select certain categories, this will then limit the mentors shown to ones that match the criteria.

The available categories are 'Role', 'Location', 'Skills' and 'Career Progression:

Each mentor card will contain a section dedicated to content that relates to the search criteria:

Each mentor card contains custom data attributes that relate to the value of the checkbox input elements. When the user selects the criteria that they would like to search for, they then confirm their selection by pressing the 'Search' button. All of the cards are then hidden by default. Next, JavaScript and jQuery are used to compare the checkbox value with the data attributes, if they match then the related mentor card is shown.

These selections use the OR operator rather than AND, this means that if a user selects 'Dublin' and 'Software Development', then they will be shown mentors that either are from Dublin or those that are not from Dublin but are Software Developers. This was used to allow users to get a wide range of mentors rather than limiting the number that can be shown.

## Initial MVP idea:
‚Äã
Following the initial team meeting, project ideas were shared and the agreed idea was to work on creating a platform to connect female mentors and mentees working in the tech industry. 
‚Äã
### Actual idea & content:
‚Äã
A web application developed as a part of Code Institute's March Hackathon based on the theme of women in tech. It features services that allow for effective communication for women in navigating the tech industry. The project achieves this by presenting mentorship opportunities through mentor profile cards where users can schedule meetings with the personalities that they feel they associate with the most. Users can find a list of upcoming events that encourage networking among women in tech. And the project also features an inspiration feature where users are presented with profiles of successful women figures.
