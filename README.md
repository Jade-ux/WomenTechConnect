## Initial MVP idea:
‚Äã
Following the initial team meeting, project ideas were shared and the agreed idea was to work on creating a platform to connect female mentors and mentees working in the tech industry. 
‚Äã
### Actual idea & content:
‚Äã
The goal of our mentorship program is to accelerate the personal and professional development of our mentees for the benefit of all. We are growing a network of women in the technology industry which matches experienced leaders with individuals entering the community. You can search through our extensive list of mentors who are looking to work with women and share their experiences to ensure their mentees meet their potential. Filter through the categories to find the right mentor for you and schedule a call. By sharing our experiences we can help our peers to accelerate their career growth and help them to navigate the rapidly growing industry. In our experience mentoring increases career progression, promotion rates, and employee satisfaction for both the mentors and mentees. Mentors get the opportunity to develop their leadership and communication skills and gain new perspectives along with the knowledge that they are building the next generation of female developers.
