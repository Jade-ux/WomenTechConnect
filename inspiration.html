        <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
        <p>
          Ada Lovelace, was a British mathematician and writer. She is considered to be the world's first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. 
          In her notes, Lovelace described how the machine could be programmed to perform a wide variety of tasks beyond just mathematical calculations. 
          She also developed a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine, which is now considered to be the world's first computer program.

        <h2>Dorothy Vaughan</h2>
        <p>
          Dorothy Vaughan was an African American mathematician and computer programmer who made significant contributions to the early years of the United States space program.
          Vaughan began her career as a teacher but later joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which later became NASA, in 1943 as a "human computer" 
          in the segregated West Area Computing unit. As a computer, Vaughan was responsible for manually analyzing and calculating complex mathematical equations and data to support 
          the work of engineers and scientists at NACA. In the 1950s, when NACA began using electronic computers, Vaughan taught herself and her colleagues programming languages such as 
          FORTRAN to program these early computers, becoming one of the first African American women to work as a computer programmer at NACA.

          Florence Nightingale was a British nurse, statistician, and social reformer. She is best known for her work as a nurse during the Crimean War and for her contributions 
          to the field of nursing. Nightingale was also a statistician and used her skills to analyze data on mortality rates and public health. She developed the polar area diagram, 
          also known as the Nightingale rose diagram, which allowed for the visual representation of complex statistical data.

          Gladys West is an American mathematician and one of the hidden figures of the space race era. West is best known for her contribution to the development of the 
          Global Positioning System (GPS), which is widely used for navigation, tracking, and mapping purposes.
          West's work involved analyzing and processing satellite data to create an accurate model of the Earth's shape, which included accounting for variations in the 
          planet's gravitational field. Her contributions helped to improve the accuracy of the GPS, which is now used for a wide range of applications, 
          including transportation, telecommunications, and military operations.

        <p>
          Katharina "KÃ¤the" Paulus was a German inventor, aerial acrobatics performer, and aviation pioneer.
          In 1913, Paulus invented the collapsible parachute, which was an improvement on previous parachute designs and allowed for easier deployment and storage. 
          She also performed as an aerial acrobat, performing stunts and demonstrations using parachutes and gliders. 
          During World War I, Paulus worked as a test pilot and instructor for the German army, and continued to promote aviation and parachute safety throughout her career.

          Katherine Johnson was an American mathematician who worked for NASA during the space race and made significant contributions to the United States' space program.
          In 1953, Johnson began working for NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), as a "human computer." She performed complex calculations 
          by hand for various aeronautics research projects. As NASA began its space program, Johnson worked on critical calculations for several historic missions, 
          including Alan Shepard's Mercury flight, John Glenn's Friendship 7 flight, and the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon. Johnson was also instrumental in helping to develop and 
          verify the trajectory for the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon, which was a significant milestone in the history of space exploration. 
          Her work helped to ensure the safety and success of the mission.

          Marie Curie (1867-1934) was a Polish-born physicist and chemist who is widely regarded as one of the most important scientists of the 20th century. 
          She is famous for her pioneering work on radioactivity and for being the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. Curie's discoveries revolutionized the field of chemistry 
          and had a profound impact on medicine, leading to the development of radiation therapy for cancer treatment. She also made significant contributions to the development 
          of X-rays during World War I, providing mobile X-ray units to help diagnose injuries in wounded soldiers.

        <h2>Williamina Fleming</h2>
        <p>
          Williamina Fleming was a Scottish-American astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of astronomy, particularly in the area of stellar spectroscopy. 
          She is perhaps best known for her work in cataloging and classifying stars and for her discovery of the Horsehead Nebula. She began working as a maid for 
          Edward Charles Pickering, the director of the Harvard College Observatory, who recognized her talents and offered her a position as a computer.
          Fleming quickly made significant contributions to the field of astronomy, developing a system for classifying stars based on their spectra, 
          or the wavelengths of light they emit. Her work helped astronomers better understand the properties of stars and their evolution.
